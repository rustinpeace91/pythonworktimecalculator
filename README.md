# pythonworktimecalculator

## Description
A program, written in Python, that adds different spans of time together, similar to a program I use for my own freelance work. The program can read from an array in a seperate file, or can take user input of hours and minutes to spit out a total of hours and minutes. 

## Instructions
1. Clone the repo
2. Run main.py
3. If you would like to calculate from a seperate file, enter your times in hours.py. Each time MUST be formatted as "hh:mm", so 12 hours and 15 minutes would be "12:15",.  Quotes and commas must be included
4. If you would like to input your own hours, choose user input
5. When you are done inputting hours and minutes, sepect total. 

## Coming soon
- Validation of the hours.py file
- A way to write the total and the user input to a file.
